 * Program Name   : Lab1 - Insect Population Growth
 * Author         : Brandon LaPointe
 * Date           : 9/19/2020    
 * Course/Section : CSC 111 - 304
 * Program Description: This program will calculate the percentage of
 *     growth for an insect colony.  First, input the initial population
 *     and then the population after 1 year.  Then determine the estimated
 *     population for year 2 and year 3. For example, if the initial population
 *     is 5, and the year 1 population is 10, then the rate of growth would be
 *     100%.  Year 2 population would be 20 and year 3 would be 40. Display
 *     the population for each year and the rate of growth as a percentage.
 *
 * Methods:
 * -------
 * main - calculates estimated insect populations
